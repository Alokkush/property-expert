## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Node.js (for Firebase deployment)
- A Google account for Firebase

### Quick Start
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the application
3. Sign up for an account to start adding properties
4. For admin access, sign up with one of the following emails:
   - admin@propertyexpert.com
   - alokkushwaha78600@gmail.com
   - admin@gmail.com (Note: Use a strong, unique password as "admin123" is commonly compromised)

### Admin Dashboard Access
1. Click the "Admin" button in the navigation bar (only visible to admin users)
2. If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to the login page
3. After successful authentication with admin credentials, you'll be granted access to the admin dashboard
4. The dashboard displays property registration analytics and system statistics

### Firebase Setup
To deploy this application with full functionality, follow these steps:

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password method)
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Update the Firebase configuration in `js/firebase-config.js`:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };
   ```
5. Set up Firestore security rules (see below)
6. Deploy using Firebase Hosting

### Firestore Security Rules
For proper security, configure your Firestore rules as follows:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Properties collection
    match /properties/{propertyId} {
      // Allow read access to all users
      allow read: if true;
      
      // Allow create access to authenticated users
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Allow update/delete only to property owners
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
                             request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Allow read access to authenticated users
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Allow create access to authenticated users
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Allow update only to the user themselves
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
                     request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🖼 Demo Image URLs

You can use these sample image URLs when adding properties:

- https://picsum.photos/400/300

Alternatively, you can type "none" or "no" in the image URL field to display a "No Image Available" placeholder.

## 👤 Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides analytics and statistics for system administrators:

### Features
- **Property Statistics**: Total properties, users, and properties added this week
- **Average Property Price**: System-wide average property price calculation
- **Location Analytics**: Bar chart showing property distribution by location
- **Time-based Analytics**: Line chart showing property additions over time
- **Recent Properties Table**: List of recently added properties with owner information

### Access
- Admin access is granted to users with specific emails:
  - admin@propertyexpert.com
  - alokkushwaha78600@gmail.com
  - admin@gmail.com (Note: Use a strong, unique password as "admin123" is commonly compromised)
- The admin button only appears for authenticated admin users
- Non-admin users attempting to access the dashboard directly will be redirected to the home page
- In a production environment, admin status would be managed through a proper role system in the database

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

- Promise-based asynchronous operations
- Error handling and user feedback mechanisms

### Firebase Integration
- Real-time database synchronization
- Secure user authentication
